## Blessed Scripts

A Blessing binds a reviewed script to its canonical path, SHA-256 digest,
interpreter, Script Declaration, Secret Names, declared Capabilities, and
optional Launcher Endorsements. The app shows the exact enrolled state and can
revoke or replace it.

### Verified execution

 Scripts are mutable text and usually run through a powerful
interpreter. Automic Vault therefore approves a verified snapshot rather than
trusting the filename. Execution normally uses a checked `/dev/fd/N` snapshot.
If the interpreter cannot execute that snapshot, you may accept canonical-path
execution during Blessing review. That exception warns on every run because
same-user code can edit the file between verification and execution. Existing
Blessings need a new review to acquire it. `AV_SCRIPT_PATH` and `AV_SCRIPT_DIR`
identify the canonical source.

### Create and review

 Put the absolute `av inject` shebang first, place the optional
Script Declaration immediately after it, review requested Secret Names and
capability ceilings, then run `av bless PATH`. Use `--endorse-launcher` only when
the exact Verified Launcher should receive automic authorization for the script.

Use the installed absolute path to `av` in the shebang. For a script that calls
hardened GitHub commands, request the Tool-specific capability without injecting
a raw token into the shell:

```sh
#!/usr/local/bin/av inject -- /bin/sh
# --- automic-vault
# capabilities:
#   gh: read-only
# ---
set -eu
gh repo view automic-vault/automic-vault --json name,url
```

Save it as `repo-info.sh`, review every command and dependency, then run:

```sh
chmod +x ./repo-info.sh
av bless ./repo-info.sh
./repo-info.sh
```

To let the current Verified Launcher use the reviewed Blessing's automic
authority, review `av bless --endorse-launcher ./repo-info.sh`. Without a
Launcher Endorsement, the Blessing itself grants that Launcher no automic
authority. Existing inherited authority still follows the declaration.

### Changes and revocation

 Editing, replacing, or moving the script invalidates
the Blessing. Re-blessing is a new security decision; review the displayed diff.
Revocation removes policy but does not undo external actions from earlier runs.

### Capability ceilings

 A capability is a ceiling, not a grant. A blessed script can still
misuse every operation inside its approved ceiling, and an interpreter remains a
large Target. Keep scripts short, deterministic, and narrow.

Without a capabilities manifest, a script inherits its execution context's
automic authority. `capabilities: { inherit: true }` makes this explicit.
`capabilities: {}` instead blocks inherited automic authority, including Launcher
policy, Direct Access Rules, outer Blessings, and Temporary Access Grants, for
later gated operations attributable to that live execution. The script's own
requested Secrets still need separate authorization. This ceiling does not
sandbox ungated commands or survive loss of observable script ancestry.

### Agent workflows

For a workflow that pauses for agent judgment and resumes deterministic work,
see [Reentrant Blessed Scripts](/docs/reentrant-scripts/). Keep agent output as
validated data and keep Secret Values out of handoff prompts and state files.
