## Approval and authority

The Approval window includes an Execution Chain with available code-signing and
runtime posture. Observed ancestors above the selected Launcher supply diagnostic
context, not authority merely by appearing there. Signing an interpreter does
not authenticate the scripts, dependencies, or plug-ins it loads.

### Touch ID Approval

Touch ID Approval authorizes an exact request on the Mac with a fresh biometric.
It accepts neither the login password nor Apple Watch fallback, and pointer or
keyboard automation cannot activate the allow action.

[![Touch ID Approval disabled, with its explicit local-authority guarantee](/docs/assets/touch-id-approval.png)](/docs/assets/touch-id-approval.png)

**Why it exists.** A local approval button can share the same input surface as an
agent. Fresh Touch ID supplies a human gesture the agent cannot synthesize while
keeping the decision at the Local Execution Boundary.

Enabling Touch ID Approval requires the current human Approval surface and
Touch ID on this Mac. The choice is Keychain-protected. By default, the Approval
window starts a fresh biometric evaluation when displayed; a successful touch
approves once. A separate presentation setting restores click-then-system-prompt
behavior. Broader Approval scopes use their own fresh evaluation.
Touch ID may coexist with iPhone Approval; the first valid result wins.

**Failure modes.** Touch ID availability, enrollment, lockout, and hardware state
can make Approval unavailable. Disabling the setting returns to the configured
non-biometric route; it does not create a password fallback inside Touch ID
Approval.

### iPhone Approval

An eligible iPhone on the same iCloud Keychain account can carry human Approval
while the Mac remains the Local Execution Boundary.

[![iPhone Approval disabled with physical-separation guidance](/docs/assets/iphone-approval.png)](/docs/assets/iphone-approval.png)

**Security basis.** When an eligible phone route is enabled, the Mac exposes no
local pointer or keyboard allow action. Separately enabled Touch ID Approval
remains available on the Mac. Phone biometric protection is optional and set
independently on each iPhone. When enabled, Approval requires Face ID or Touch ID
on that physical phone, with no passcode fallback; Apple Watch Approval is
unavailable. Without it, actionable notifications may appear on Apple Watch.
iPhone Mirroring and Show on Mac can weaken physical separation: enable
biometric protection on every eligible iPhone to retain that boundary.

An allow response requires an active, App Store-verified iPhone Approval
subscription. Denial does not. A subscription never grants operation authority.
Unknown operations, Secret Disclosure, Unconstrained Secret Application, and
requests with security warnings require review in the full iPhone app.

The phone's Request History holds at most 50 protected local summaries of sent
responses and received cancellations. It does not establish that the Mac
accepted a response or allowed an operation and does not replace Authorization
History on the Mac. Background cancellation delivery may be delayed or lost.

**Recovery.** Recovery uses system authentication, rotates the account key, and
invalidates all prior phone registrations across the account. Recovery disables
iPhone Approval and cancels pending requests. Re-enrollment is account-wide;
ordinary disable and re-enable does not rotate the key.

**Availability.** Network, relay, iCloud Keychain, device lock, and biometric
state can prevent the phone from carrying Approval. Unavailability is not a
reason for the Mac to manufacture a weaker local allow action.

**Remote work from a locked Mac.** iPhone Approval does not unlock the Mac's
Keychain. Before leaving an agent running remotely, configure
[Available While Locked](#availability) for each Secret it needs. A Secret that
requires an unlocked Mac can stop the request before Approval, so you receive
no phone notification.

### Automic Authorization feedback

Policy-authorized operations can show a notification, flash the menu bar, or
show nothing. This controls feedback, not authority.

[![Automic Authorization feedback options with Flash Menu Bar selected](/docs/assets/automic-authorization.png)](/docs/assets/automic-authorization.png)

Authorization History remains populated in every mode. Approval prompts and
policy-denial notices are unaffected. Choose quieter feedback only after the
team knows where to inspect History; silence is not an audit control.

### Temporary Access Grants

For a supported agent workflow, the Approval menu can grant ten minutes of
memory-only **Write Access** instead of approving only once.

[![A GitHub write request whose approval menu can issue a task-scoped temporary grant](/docs/assets/temporary-access-grant.png)](/docs/assets/temporary-access-grant.png)

The grant binds to the exact Tool-specific Gate, Verified Launcher, accepted
runtime, and Agent Task Context. It excludes Direct Access, Secret mutation,
Disclosure, elevated operations, and unknown operations. The task label narrows
matching but is forgeable context, not identity. The Verified Launcher and live
request checks remain essential.

The initial budget is ten active minutes. A persistent strip shows remaining
time, successful-use count, last use, and actions to add ten minutes, suspend or
resume the countdown, or end the grant. Suspension also suspends authority.
An optional setting collapses the strip after five seconds into a visible warning
tab; the menu-bar shield stays orange and the menu retains the End action.

Grants are revoked when the user session becomes inactive, displays sleep, an
update begins, or the service exits. A queued request may match a grant at its
decision point only after fresh live checks and within that exact scope.
An explicit empty script capability ceiling blocks grant matching.

### Detached Processes

Detached Processes controls **Retained Launcher Provenance**: whether an eligible
live descendant may keep the verified launcher chain after its original parent
exits.

[![Detached Processes off by default with the authority-extension warning](/docs/assets/detached-processes.png)](/docs/assets/detached-processes.png)

**Security tradeoff.** Enabling extends authority after the observed parent
chain disappears. Same-user code injection can pass that retained authority to
injected code. An exact live enrolled Launcher Bundle payload can represent its
own bundle after the launcher exits without enabling this setting.

**Scope.** Retention is execution-scoped. It keeps neither an old authorization
decision nor blanket authority for new processes or Gates. Enabling requires
Approval; disabling is immediate. Leave it off unless a real daemon or detached
worker cannot preserve the original launcher chain another way.

### GPG Signing

GPG Signing stores an armored OpenPGP private key in Secret Custody and routes
Git through `av-gpg` and `av gpg-sign`. Git receives a detached signature, never
the private key.

[![GPG Signing Secret Gate with exact launcher overrides set to Allow Signing](/docs/assets/gpg-signing.png)](/docs/assets/gpg-signing.png)

```sh
git config --global gpg.program av-gpg
git config --global gpg.format openpgp
git config --global commit.gpgSign true
```

Settings can import a key or generate an alternate EdDSA key. The private key is
never displayed; the public key can be copied. Alternate access can be limited
to exact Verified Launchers. The Secret Gate offers **Approval Required**,
**Allow Signing**, and **Deny**. Approval binds to the payload SHA-256; `av gpg-sign` reads at
most 16 MiB and returns GnuPG-compatible status plus the detached signature.

**Limits.** A valid signature proves possession of the signing authority for
that payload, not that the commit is safe or reviewed. Protect Git configuration
and verify the repository and payload shown by the workflow.

### SSH Agent

Open **Settings → SSH Agent** and choose **Add SSH Key…** to import an OpenSSH
private key or generate an Ed25519 key. Register the displayed public key with
your service, enable the agent, and choose **Configure OpenSSH**. The agent
supports up to 32 named credentials, each with its own Default Policy and
Verified Launcher rules, also available in **Authorization Gates**.

New keys start at **Approval Required**. The original credential retains
`AV_SSH_CREDENTIAL` and its existing policy. Each gate offers **Approval Required**,
**Allow Authentication**, and **Deny**. Rename changes only the label; replacing a
key means adding a fresh credential and reviewing fresh policy.

You can allow an agent to use a GitHub key while requiring Approval for a separate
homelab key. Names do not restrict destinations: use distinct keys at those
services. Allow Authentication can permit remote writes and is not Read Only.

SSH clients receive authentication signatures, never private keys. Each request
binds the exact public-key digest to that credential's policy and Global Value;
Project Values do not apply. Public-key enumeration needs no Secret Use. OpenSSH
may try more than one key; each Approval covers only the selected credential.
Key mutation through the agent protocol and arbitrary signing are unsupported.

Each signature requires a verified local socket peer and live original Launcher
ancestry. Missing or changed ancestry denies use. There is no credential fallback,
Temporary Access Grant, retained provenance, or decision reuse. An explicit
`ssh-agent: trusted` Blessed Script Capability covers only the original credential,
while its exact execution remains in the client's verified ancestor chain. It
grants no access to new keys. An empty capability ceiling blocks inherited
automic authority.

Imports leave existing private-key files, Keychain passphrases, and other agents'
keys intact. Verify the protected route before removing these separate access
paths. A forwarded or shared connection can carry other software's requests under
the local client's Launcher attribution. See
[ADR 0064](https://github.com/automicvault/automicvault/blob/main/docs/adr/0064-per-credential-ssh-authority.md).

### Secret Name Access

Exact Verified Apps may run `av list` without an Approval window; all other apps
require Approval.

[![Secret Name Access with two exact verified apps allowed to run av list](/docs/assets/secret-name-access.png)](/docs/assets/secret-name-access.png)

This capability lists Secret Names only. It does not read, change, apply, or
disclose Values and grants no Direct Access. Remove an app when its listing use
ends; a similarly named or newly signed app does not inherit the exact rule.

### Authorization History Access

An exact Verified Launcher may read local Authorization History with
`av history` without an Approval prompt only after you add it to the separate
Authorization History Access row in Settings. Other Verified Launchers require
Approval for each read; unverifiable Launchers also need Approval. The grant
exposes cumulative request metadata, including Secret Names and software
identities, but never Secret Values. It does not permit
`av list`, and a Secret Name Access grant does not permit `av history`.

The Mac records each successful history read before returning records. Remove
the Launcher from this row when it no longer needs unattended access.

### About and menu bar

About reports the running version and GUI PATH captured before shell startup.
Use both when diagnosing a mismatch between the app and an interactive shell.

[![About showing Automic Vault 3.16.0 and the pre-shell GUI PATH](/docs/assets/about.png)](/docs/assets/about.png)

The menu bar opens the main window, checks for updates, quits the service, and
surfaces live Secret Uses and Temporary Access Grants without displaying Values.
Quitting ends memory-only grants and proxy state; it does not undo operations or
revoke Values already delivered to Targets.

## Secrets, Values, and selection

```sh
av save GH_TOKEN
av save --project-directory=. GH_TOKEN
av save --project-directory=/absolute/project AWS_PROFILE
```

### Saving safely

A Secret Name is a letter or underscore followed by letters, digits, or
underscores. `av save` canonicalizes an existing Project Directory, rejects the
filesystem root, and requires Approval before creating or updating a Value.
Without an input flag it reads one hidden line from `/dev/tty` and removes the
terminal line ending.

For multiline input, including a PEM:

```sh
av save --multiline --project-directory=. DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Input stays hidden. Press Ctrl-D after the final newline to finish, or Ctrl-D
twice to finish without a final newline. Ctrl-C cancels without saving. This
mode preserves received whitespace, but terminal line editing, line-length
limits, and newline processing still apply.

For exact bytes from a pipe or an existing readable descriptor:

```sh
av save --stdin DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY <&3
```

`--stdin` reads to EOF without trimming or newline conversion and refuses
terminal stdin. Both flags work with Global Values and `--project-directory`;
they cannot be combined. Input must be nonempty UTF-8 without NUL bytes, at most
1 MiB. Keep the producer's Secret output out of arguments, environment variables,
logs, and plaintext files. Review the destination: an approved save can replace
an existing Global Value or the specified Project Value.

See [copying selected v1 Values](/docs/workflows/#copy-selected-v1-secrets) for a
manual legacy Keychain copy procedure and its limits.

Save the replacement before deleting the old credential. Test a harmless read
through the protected route, inspect History, then remove the plaintext source.
For a supported Tool, prefer its hardener because the hardener knows the native
credential format and can validate the migration.

### Value selection

For each requested name, Automic Vault selects the nearest Project Value at or
above the physical canonical working directory on the same filesystem. If none
matches, it selects the Global Value. The selection happens before policy so the
Authorization Request can identify the chosen source.

Project Directory is a selector, not project identity, a repository trust signal,
or an authorization boundary. Symlinks and logical shell paths do not create a
second identity. A selected Value read failure never falls back to a broader
Global Value; fallback after failure could silently substitute the wrong account.

### Availability

Secret Availability controls whether Keychain can supply a Secret in the Mac's
current lock state. **When Unlocked** keeps it unavailable while the Mac is
locked. **Available While Locked** makes it available after the first unlock
following a restart. The Secret Gate still verifies and authorizes every
operation. See the canonical
[Secret Availability definition](https://github.com/automicvault/automicvault/blob/main/docs/domain-language.md#secret-availability).

To prepare for remote work, unlock the Mac, run `av open`, open **Secrets**, and
select the Secret. Enable **Available While Locked** for each Secret your remote
workflow needs. For GitHub, check the relevant `GH_TOKEN_…` account and host
entries. The setting applies to every Value of that Secret; enable it only for
Secrets you need while locked.

iPhone Approval can carry a required human decision while the Mac is locked,
but cannot make a When Unlocked Secret available. Policy may authorize a read
without prompting. Keep the Mac and originating process running, then test a
read such as `gh auth status` from the same remote agent while the Mac is locked.
This setting does not wake or start a Mac after shutdown or remove the need for
its first unlock after restarting.

### Direct Secret Access

The Direct Secret Gate binds exact Secret Names to one Verified Launcher, but is
broad with respect to Target and arguments. Direct Access Rules authorize
environment-mode injection; FD delivery requires fresh human Approval. They permit Secret Application only;
it does not list, mutate, or disclose Values. Prefer a Tool-specific Gate whose
classifier understands read, write, host, registry, or other operation semantics.

## Access Levels

| Access Level | Authority |
| --- | --- |
| Approval Required | Every matching request needs human Approval. |
| Read Only | Apply Secrets only to operations the Tool-specific Gate classifies as read-only. |
| Read & Update | Homebrew-only authority for reads and the supported update path. |
| Local Write | Permit supported local writes without broader remote authority. |
| Write Access | Permit write operations recognized by that Tool-specific Gate. |
| Full Access | Strongest supported Gate authority, potentially including elevated Application or Disclosure where explicitly defined. |
| Direct Access | Apply exact names through the Direct Gate for one Verified Launcher; no Target or argument classifier. |

Access Levels are Gate vocabulary, not interchangeable global roles. **Write
Access** for GitHub and **Write Access** for another Tool are evaluated by
different classifiers. Unknown operations fail closed or require Approval rather
than inheriting the nearest-sounding label.

The strongest Secret Gate preset appears as **Secret Disclosure**, including
Write Access; AWS uses **Elevated Secret Application**. Execution Gates retain
**Full Access**. These labels do not change authority or Blessed Script syntax.

New Secret Gates default to Read Only; GPG Signing to Approval Required;
SSH Agent to Approval Required; Homebrew to Read & Update; Direct Access to
Approval Required. GPG Signing offers Allow Signing, and SSH Agent offers
Allow Authentication, rather than the general-purpose presets.
